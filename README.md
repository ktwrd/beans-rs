# beans-rs
A Sourcemod Installer written with Rust, using the kachemak versioning system. Intended for general-purpose use, and for server owners.

This is a complete rewrite of the original [beans](https://github.com/int-72h/ofinstaller-beans) installer, but with rust, and extended support.

`beans-rs` is licensed under `GPLv3-only`, so please respect it!

**Note** Releases for Linux v1.5.0 and later are built with Ubuntu 20.04 (using `libssl v1.1`)

## Developing
Requirements
- Rust Toolchain (nightly, only for building)
    - Recommended to use [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) to install.
- x86-64/AMD64 Processor ([see notes](#notes-binaries))
- OpenSSL v3 (also required on deployments)
- **Following requirements are only required for testing**
- Steam Installed
    - Source SDK Base 2013 Multiplayer ([install](steam://instal/243750))

## Contributing
When creating a PR, please please please branch off the `develop` branch. Any PRs that are created after the 7th of June 2024 that **do not** use `develop` as the base branch will be closed.

When adding a new feature (that a user will interact with), create a new file in `src/workflows/` with the name of the feature (for example, `launch.rs`). Inside of `launch.rs` you would have a struct with the name of `LaunchWorkflow`. It would look something like this;
```rust
use crate::{RunnerContext, BeansError};

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct LaunchWorkflow {
    pub context: RunnerContext
}
impl LaunchWorkflow {
    pub async fn wizard(ctx: &mut RunnerContext) -> Result<(), BeansError>
    {
        todo!("Logic for handling the LaunchWorkflow")
    }
}
```
You would also be adding a subcommand for this ins `main.rs`. In `Launcher::run()` you would add the following ***before*** `.args` is called on `cmd`, and after the last `.subcommand()` that is used. What you would add would look like the following;
```rust
.subcommand(Command::new("launch")
    .about("Launch the currently installed game")
    .arg(Launcher::create_location_arg()))
```

All sub-commands must have the `--location` argument added so the end-user can specify if they have a custom location for their `sourcemods` folder.

Next you'd add a match case so `Launcher::subcommand_processor(&mut self)`, which would look like the following;
```rust
Some(("launch", install_matches)) => {
    self.task_launch(install_matches).await;
}
```

Then, you'd add a new function to `Launcher`, which would actually call `LaunchWorkflow`. It would look something like the following (if there is only the `--location` argument);
```rust
pub async fn task_launch(&mut self, matches: &ArgMatches) {
    self.to_location = Launcher::find_arg_sourcemods_location(&matches); // must be done when the `--launcher` argument is provided on the subcommand!
    if let Err(e) = LaunchWorkflow::wizard(&mut ctx).await {
        panic!("Failed to run LaunchWorkflow {:#?}", e);
    } else {
        logic_done(); // must be called when any flow of logic has completed.
    }
}
```

## Notes
### Binaries
All the bundled/embedded binaries are for x86-64/AMD64 systems. We only support that architecture because that's what Open Fortress supports.

Please do not make any PRs to remove the embedded executables in favor of downloading. Some users would like to use this application offline, or they may have unreliable internet.

Linux Systems not using glibc have not been tested.
